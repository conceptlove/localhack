# LocalHack

Build sharable tools quickly without servers.

## Todo

- [ ] CLI
- [ ] UI Kit
  - [x] `WindowEngine`
  - [ ] UI Editor
    - [ ] Meta mode
- [ ] Engine-powered CLI
  - I want to write CLI tools as an `update` function; the current sub-command
    is the action, and the state is persisted to disk between runs.
