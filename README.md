# LocalHack

Build sharable tools quickly without servers.

More info coming soon. So far, this is primarily a repo of experiments and
ideas.

## Notes

We're attempting to write the LocalHack source in [Literate][literate] style.
It's an idea we find interesting and are excited to give it a try.

LocalHack implements its own data-architecture called [Sift][sift].

[sift]: src/lib/Sift.md
[literate]: src/plugins/Literate.md
